# Changelog

All notable changes to Context Sync will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-16

### üéâ Initial Release

**The Problem We're Solving:**
Every developer using AI for coding faces this: you build something with Claude in one chat, close it, open a new chat the next day, and Claude has completely forgotten your project. You end up explaining the same context 10 times.

**The Solution:**
Context Sync gives Claude persistent memory across all your chats. Start a project Monday, Claude remembers it Friday. Open a new chat anytime, context automatically loads.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Cross-Chat Memory** - Context persists across all Claude chats automatically
- **Project Management** - Track multiple projects with their own context
- **Decision History** - Remember architectural choices and why you made them
- **Conversation Archive** - Never lose important technical discussions
- **MCP Prompts** - Automatic context injection at conversation start
- **Local Storage** - All data stays on your machine (SQLite database)
- **Universal Setup** - One script works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### üõ†Ô∏è MCP Tools

- `init_project` - Initialize or switch to a project
